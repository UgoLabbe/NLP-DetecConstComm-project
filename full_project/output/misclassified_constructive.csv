the liberals have really hurt their chance by coronate the debutante from montreal . they be all giddy with the enthusiasm that a young fresh face bring but canadian will have nearly two year to figure out that he be a empty vessel that should have stick to snowboarding or thespianism . i can not wait for the conservative ad that ask the pointed question ' why be trudeau charge canadian school and charity $ 270000 for speech while he be a highly pay millionaire mp ? '. there be no credible answer to that .
"i remember the extra cost of electricity at be 37 billion dollar . be you try to help out ms wynne as well with her green energy scam ?? it be very disappointing to see the ontario electorate not be able to see through the liberal nonsense , and voting for they again and again . anytime you hear someone use the term ' revenue tool ' you know they be try to gouge you with a new tax . time to clean the manure out of the ontario provincial barn . i hope a lesson have be learn , and the canadian electorate will not allow trudeau to continue with the same goofy logic as the ontario liberals"

"american still cherish their constitution 's separation of governmental power . 'sure , they may ' cherish ' they , but they also go about their work and life , unaware , or uncomplaining when ' governmental power ' kill american citizen ( and other ) without due process of law , without arrest , trail , etc. , all for ' counter - terrorism . ' america do not need to fear a few ' militiamen ' squatt on federal land in oregon . it need to fear the death - warrant - signing president and his ' secret op ' killer on the ground and their drone in the sky . the ' politics of fear ' the writer talk about be not the sole perview of republican on the campaign trail . and as for the assertion that ' anti-elitism can be fan by vast individual wealth , because elitism be define less by financial clout than by education . ' well , that statement just prove the point that anybody -- even a ' professor of democracy , human right and journalism ' -- can be misl . you need only consider donald trump . my case : that who wallow in trump-mania forget his wealth make he the elite , and , fruthermore , most of the maniacal could not give a fig about education . this be the ' show i the money ' era , as never before ( yeah , yeah , i know : carnagie , vanderbilt , rockefeller , but ... ) consider the money make by 21st century athlete , who , in addition to everything else , receive multi-million dollar signing bonus . unheard of in the 19th or early 20th century ...

' not to say ' skeptical journalist ' do not have person to fear . they do--people in power . not the angry powerless . if ' angry person ' be enrage at barack obama , it be not because of the color of his skin ( who care , today ? ) nor his ' education ' , but simply because he seem deaf and dumb to the factor that cause person their fear : personal job loss and financial ruin , drug , terrorist crazy amongst they , violent crazy amongst they . you know , that stuff ."
"do quebec really think that can survive as a independent nation ? how be their economy do ? and their debt ? and how would they do without all that transfer payment from canada ? have they ever really think this through ? my canada have always include quebec but this be get rather tiresome for roc . and if they do go , no canadian passport or currency for they as they have want in the past . indpendent be independent ! and finally , i would like to see marois try and run a country ! ha ! she would not last long !"
"the gravy train would be over if trumps get in and that be what the establishment be scared of . but let ask a serious question . be the us superpower on the way up or in a downfall ? i think it be pretty hard to argue to say that they be not fall . so , should they stick with the same ( pork barrelling , special interest , back room deal etc. . ) or try something completely different . if i be american i would vote for real change . on their current path it be all downhill from here and we will follow ."
"' this be the route take by u.s. democrat when they choose barack obama as their presidential candidate , after year of lose to the republican under george w. bush . it be the route take by canadian liberals in put forward justin trudeau after two false start down '' the - leader - be - the - whole - answer '' road with stéphane dion and michael ignatieff . ' what a load of manure ! dion and ingatieff be ok leader . what they could not withstand be the barrage of negative advertising that be fund by the con , well in advance of the election and throughout the election . by the time justin come around the strategy be all too clear and fail as a result . government be not vote into office , they be vote out . that say , the option have to be see as palatable . i agree that in order to be re-elect the con must look closely at who they be what they really stand for . this include social value , something i notice be not clearly include on your list . in the past the con be electable because they be fiscally conservative and socially liberal . they cater to ' small c' conservatives . this no long appear to be the case . i be a small c conservative . i will have no interest in this party unless they revisit their policy ."
"a very flawed piece , and one i see come after amanda get all testy with a guest who be argue against outsource on her show last night . some observation : - ontario to alberta be not the same thing as ontario to india . someone live in alberta be almost assure to spend most , if not all of their income within canada ( rare exception ) . indian can spend their money wherever they wish half a world away . - we have one of the good university system in the world , with 2 highly tout one in the gta ( and another in there as well ) . i hardly see how this would make we less qualified to do a position over someone from india , who , with all due respect , have cereal box diploma that do not mean much over here . - fail to acknowledge the concept that person be okay with outsource , but not okay with insourcing ( bring in tfws ) and fire canadian worker to do so ( the antithesis of the program . obviously this piece be design to calm person 's anger about the dbag - ness of rbc , but from most of the comment i have read , person see through this weak argument . so ... nice try amanda , but ... fayl !"

kind of like the billy bishop deal . jr 101 economics . stop the runway extension and lot of short term construction job that will help downtown toronto business and cost more job gain . stop 2 billion order of quiet jet from bombardier where lot 's of job would be create and stop expansion of porter airline and more job and then flush a couple biilion with handout to bombardier . that make sense .
"he do in fact have a obligation to not involve himself in the political process . there be a long standing directive that be renew every 4 year state that member of the justice department should not take action that could be view as political in nature within 60 day of a election . he choose instead to ignore this and for what . they do not even know the content of the email and give the prior precedent of the recommendation that he make a few month ago it be unlikely that his conclusion will change . therefore , he could end up hand the election to trump and cost the democrat many down ballot seat and then announce once the investigation be conclude that there be no change in the fbis position on clinton 's activity . that to i be a huge gamble with the electoral process and the reputation of the fbi ."
"like most canadian , i applaud professor grayson for his rational approach to this issue . nevertheless i sense in the writing of this article , the heavy hand of york university 's myopic , misogynistic , misguided , overly placative administration . the university president and faculty dean take the route of least resistance , which be to accommodate a bigoted request from one male student at the expense of female student - and all woman - everywhere . what this story , the story of the aikido student in novo scotia , and the now almost daily incidence of the tolerance of canadian be try by religious zealot tell we be that quebec 's charter of values be only a first step toward bring rationality to the interpretation of human right in this country . this threat can only be thwart by a concerted move to secularization in our society . only through secularization can we ensure that gender equality , racial equality and other such innate right take precedence over the grow array of complex , conflicting , and confound religious practice be foist on canadian . any accommodation that diminish and demean woman - such as that insist upon by york university - must be reject soundly as gender discrimination . i can tell york what my 17 year old daughter have tell i - that york university be no long on her list of respected , prospective post - secondary institution ."

"the current political show that be currently be play out , be become a protest vote against the current elite . the dis-function of congress and in particular , the gop swing to the far right , have allow the like of trump and cruz to percolate to the surface , with cruz be the most dangerous of all the candidate . trump be in the lead because he be give voice to the ' protest ' movement as person feel they have become disenfranchise and feel helpless in the face of the increase power of the elite . saunders be do the very same , as the 40s and under be flock to his support , because they feel the middle class american dream , be no long attainable . when you have mitt romney state that 47 % of american pay no federal tax , what he be say be that that 47 % be impoverished even though they work full time job at $ 8.00 per hour and get food stamp to maintain basic living standard . this in essence be corporate welfare for the walmarts of the world , as their employee be on food stamp because they do not receive a basic living wage , all in the persuit of profit . a excellent tvo documentary to view be ' the super rich and us' which outline the hollowing out of the middle class , to support the rich elite and the 47 % at the bottom . who bail out the bank ( super rich ) but the tax payer and then we be tell that we have to cut their tax even further , yet we be tell we will have to cut health benefitsbernie and the donald be lighten rod for that anger and feeling of helplessness currently be feel by the electorate ."
"deflection and obfuscation , that be what this article consist of . it be not about monsef 's actual place of birth . rather it be a legitimate question - in light of mount evidence - of whether she deliberately lie about her place of birth in order to perpetuate a specific narrative about her life and further her political ambition . it be also a question of whether she deliberately lie about her place of birth while take certain solemn oath to this nation . the obama birther issue be completely different because there never be any evidence to begin with that he be bear somewhere other than hawaii , so the ' birther ' be essentially just make accusation from thin air without merit . that be not the case with monsef 's critic ."
very great idea not include the vast array and source of criticism towards boyden 's work or use of a fn identity . his description and identify as ' two - spirit ' alone render this article wrong on the point of his sincerity . somehow in the vast amount of research he have do into aboriginal culture and history he have miss key important identity and information .
"i stop at ' building on flood plain and government will power ...'! miller be a shill for the world wildlife fund and as a reasonably intelligent person should know , there be absolutley nothing toronto or for that matter , canada can do about the concept of green house gass emission , climate change or global warming . our mission clearly must focus on prepare our infrastructure to protect our community from extreme weather condition not fight china and india about coal fire electrical plant . we be not don quixote ! by the way , as mayor of toronto , how do you manage our sewer system to prevent flooding toxic effluent into pristine lake ontario and prevent a explosion in e-colin ? i think so ! think and act local ."

"i really have to wonder how deep the control over the media be or how dumb most reporter be ? how can anyone in their right mind say that america be ever great ? a nation build on the back of slave , a nation that continue to use black american as free labour through a system that be create to target black american for imprisionment once it become obvious that it just be not socially acceptable to have slave anymore . a nation who no long allow a person who have be release from the prison system to ever vote ! a country that allow its public to go into massive debt to pay basic health care need , a country that have steal so much from aboriginal person and continue to do so today . i be sorry , what part of any of that be great ? any accomplishment that america have make in the last 200- 300 year be make through suppression , theft , manipulation and greed . america be not a country . it be a corporation and once she be do rape the person within her own border she will set her eye on the rest of the world ( which be another story that have already begin ) . it be really time to stop strok the massive ego of this corrupt nation / corporation ."

"the article be right . i would say that the us be actually in a slow sad collapse with it 's deficit out of control , reserve currency status under threat , continuous war overseas with blatant lie , citizen standard of living decline , unemployment figure manipulate to look good , city go bankrupt etc. . this be why we see strange behavior and populism in the speech and debate . exceptionalism with the idea that the president be the most important leader in the world . idea that the us will be great again if we just get tough with all that not so exceptional person out there . if they try to reform the system they can not since the control money establishment will not and can not give the money and power up . even if they want to it would still collapse the system a redistribution be not possible the country be bankrupt while still in control since the dollar be the reserve currency . if they try the back to basic route and let the market fix everything it will end in total social unrest then martial law , then a total breakdown , then a worldwide dump of the dollar . if they try to continue control the world economy this be obviously head toward world war three or some version of it . other country be all tired of the show . basically the election be a show . i would say that none of the actor right now can carry out any of their reform . democracy be basically manipulate at this time in the us . diane"

"this be a very poorly construct piece . the title suggest that obama and trudeau be vindictive , yet do nothing to support that . it say , essentially , that they beat unpopular leader . if the globe pay for this , the globe should ask for its money back . and the refrain from obama 's right - lean detractor always overlook that the tea part faction in the republican party would soon douse themselves in gasoline , raise tax from abortion clinic and surrender their assault rifle than co-operate with obama . this whine always centre on his first term ; his second have be very successful . maybe a stop payment can be put on the cheque before it get cash ?"

"hard to fathom this piece . essentially , mr. harper be not a democrat . he really do not believe in democracy . he play only to his base with the politics of fear and divisiveness . he could care less about that outside of his base . the bad myth about he be that he have manage the economy well . he blow the inherit surplus before the economic crisis hit and it be our stable banking system that get we through the crisis , not anything he do . he take the word ' progressive ' out of his party 's name . he should have replace it with ' regressive .

"neither harper or the tories deserve another mandate !! this be not the ' tories ' i be raise to support and support year ago . harper can not be trust to give up power . what on earth suggest he would ? do you honestly believe that prime minister calandra , fantino , or poilievre would not continue to same pattern of nonsense , lack of compassion or outright disdain ? if trudeau be not ready to lead , what suggest that anyone in the cpc have demonstrate they have the fortitude and moral to stand up to harper ... for 10 year . none . how many senior cpc 's be go to gleefully sit ringside at the ford circus this weekend ? take back our country canada !"

"i support mr. chretien when he refuse to join bush in 2003 . but in this article , this statesman who i really admire , be show a remarkable lack of savvy . no matter what the international community do and do not do , biden be right on the mark when he say that iraq need to be divide into three part - sunni , kurd and shia . this folk can not live with each other in peace .... just like orthodox serbs , catholic croats and bosnian muslim could not help but massacre each other . nowhere in any of the plan propose by any of the so call expert acknowledge this reality . for this to happen , international force must step in between three faction and enforce peace while boundary be be decide . that be the only way forward . take in 50000 refugee be stupid and hartisan . why only that 50000 ? what about the sunni kill by shia militia or vice versa ? how many more need a shelter and protection from violence ?"

"alas , harper 's year in public office have do nothing to counter the image of his supporter as the bottom of the barrel of the electorate -- anti-intellectual , anti-cosmopolitan , ignorant and mean - spirit . it be the demographic that swallow attack ad whole , because it know no good . harper 's political opponent have never manage to figure this out . they keep try to trip he up on matter of policy , a tactic which leave out of account the depth of the man 's cynicism . he be not embarrass that the transparent incoherence of attack ad ' reality ' do not add up to a persuasive argument for the more discerning . as long as there be voter susceptible of be exploit , he will take advantage of their limited cognitive skill and cartoon - level understanding . other country have their share of individual sadly lack in smart , compassion and basic human decency , of course ; but harper have bring the combination to the fore so that it now represent canada . it be a simplistic world he fashion for his supporter , but they buy it and imagine they can function in it . unfortunately , what work for they have little to offer that who be struggle to come to term with the real world and its complex challenge ."
"newspaper endorse political party all the time and they do not always endorse the same party consistently . this editorial 's argument , though , have a major flaw as the current cpc be essentially one man . without even go on personality , the fact that no conservative candidate have show up for local debate be glaring case in point . so i would like to first see what this party would look like under different leadership and the only way that it be possible be for someone else to take over while cpc regroup . this be kind of what happen to the liberals in 2011 . now they have regroup and ready ( include their leader ) ."
"while i support trudeau 's call to reform our marijuana law , he erred in judgement by smoke it follow become a mp . as a legislator , he should show respect for the authority of the parliament in which he sit , and not bring it into disrepute by disregard its law make power by break the law himself ."
"for what it be worth , i agree with you gary . for trudeau to admit publicly that he smoke pot be worthy of little more than a shrug , in my book . but here be where the real hypocrisy lie . pot be big business in bc , as you know . so be many other illicit drug - meth , ecstasy , cocaine , heroin . yet the west coast media - and business establishment - turn a blind eye to where billion of dollar in bc 's illegal drug profit wind up . clearly , it have a big impact on the bc economy - from house price and luxury car to ' bling ' and casino revenue . just a week ago , a $ 1.3 million house in richmond be seize by cop after it be use as a grow op . thousand of other property be also use as grow op , inflate house value . no wonder it have be report that thousand of investor - own condo in vancouver sit empty . how about a column that honestly address this issue ? i would love to read that ."
"i could not agree more with mr. chretien 's assessment of what canada 's role should be against isis - to provide ' massive , not token , humanitarian assistance ' that would include as he suggest , take in 50000 refugee and the allocation of $ 100 million to the world food program plus dispense with what be obviously a marginal military contribution at good , make with zero opposition leader collaboration and zero opposition mp support in the house by this elect harper dictatorship . and like chretien , i too believe the lion 's share of the fight against isis need to be mainly shoulder by arab nation with minimal participation by the west and not the other way around . bottom line : sure wish trudeau have be the one properly able to articulate this liberal position rather than i have to read former leader chretien do it for he !!"

"by their companion and friend shall you know they ... there be something very unsavoury about stephen harper , who i acknowledge be a very intelligent and canny man . this unsavoury quality be well demonstrate by look at the low class , crass , boorish , thuggish man he have surround himself with - the john baird , jim flahertys ( whom i actually no quite a bit about , and no , he be no economic star ! but obviously a well train mouthpiece for sure ) , tony clements , etc. - some the leaving of the mike harris crowd from the 90s ( the same thuggish , boorish , under-educated chap ) , and other who be so similar they may have well be part of that early gang . this fellow seem united in their desire for some kind of macho crime - fighting , warrior nation to emerge out of their effort . give canada 's political stature in the world and the rate of crime plummete to the basement , this ambition be childish and laughable . moreover , for the first term or two in office , i be not even sure mr. harper be here to represent canadian - his loyalty be all about alberta , and i use to wonder if he may not ultimately be work towards break up the country - to ' free ' alberta from the rest of this indigent nation , and perhaps to cleave unto the u.s. , which he so admire . so yes , high time for this man to move on . the alternative be not great unfortunately , but we will make do nonetheless ."

everyone laugh at the multi-levelled class system in britain but it have its merit - not least be a more nuanced approach to define middle class . the use of middle - class in canada and the us be far too broad a brush as it seem to mean pretty well everyone between school leave age and retirement . the traditional middle - class be the professional class of well educate person and nothing more . the under-educated working guy that one poster talk about be not and never will be middle class - he be low work class ( or pick wehatever name you prefer ) and have a whole different set of problem that require different solution . we need some more nuance in this debate because a one - size - fit - all political solution be not go to solve thing for anyone .

"in the midst of a discussion of canadian value in quebec , i ask why do quebec overwhelmingly vote ndp last election ? the answer be simple : jack layton . so perhaps the good question to ask at this juncture be : what would jack layton do ?

i get a feeling this race - bait and make everything about race be ignore a lot of reality . it be far more meaningful to adopt marxist analysis ( do marx ever refer to race ? ) and talk about social - economic class rather than skin colour . there be lot of poor ' white ' person out there who be no good off than the poor ' black ' person out there . they be in the same boat . this article just do not impress i at all .
it be truly ludicrous that not one of the comment i see question our total economic dependence on the fossil fuel industry . i suppose canadian be happy enough be ' hewer of wood and drawer of water ' for the rest of the civilised world . why would we aspire to anything great -- why change the roller coaster cycle of boom and bust and investigate thermal energy or other new - fangled idea ?
we do not have true freedom of religion in this country . one be only free to get exemption to rule for one religion if it happen to be one of the major one . if i want to start my own religion and demand a exception from something base on the that religion i will not get it . freedom of religion really mean freedom to practice a standard old organize religion .

"thank you for the article margaret and globeandmail , intrigue and think - provoke as always ! as a medical graduate and aspire dietician , i argue that neither saturate fat , non-saturated fat or sugar make we fat . calory make we fat . weight loss be base on a calorie deficit , or burn more calorie than you consume daily . what you eat do not really matter . if your body burn 2250 kcal / day , you can eat 8 slice of pizza at 2000 kcal and lose weight , correct ? the reason why i be so worried about fat be because fat have 9 calorie / gram , while carb have 4 calorie / gram . it be easy to get fat with fat , but if you can not calorie it do not matter . maintain a good weight and bmi to reduce morbidity and mortality be a lifestyle choice that we can all make . my suggestion for that who be struggle to lose weight be to count calorie and make sure you be in a calorie deficit daily , and find a good diet . do research and read some excellent diet review ( http://goo.gl/mbpvrt) and pick one that suit you , keep in mind any diet will work as long as there be a calorie deficit . a high protein diet , frequent meal and high - carb cheat day help maintain metabolism so you can keep the weight you lose off :) . its become more and more easy to blame what we eat for our weight problem , but i believe the answer lie in how much we eat . good luck everyone . thank you for the great article globeandmail ."

"mr. gibson , this be a excellent article . i live in b.c. and i remember the referendum that you allude to in your column . i appreciate the fact that gordon campbell 's government put the propose change to our electoral system to a vote and let the person decide . in the end , british colombians have a say in this very important matter . all canadian should have a say in any propose electoral change . democracy should not be tamper with by self serving politician or political party ."

"re : editorial board 's 2015 election endorsementi be rarely at a loss for word but i must admit when i read your recommendation today , i be truly flabbergast . my first question to myself be - so what be the voter suppose to do ? how can i vote for the conservatives without voting mr. harper back in ? unless we have somehow change to the american system , the prime minister be the leader of the party that hold the confidence of the house . surely if the con be re-elect mr. harper will not step down ; nor be it likely that the bunch of lapdog that make up his caucus and party will ask he to do so . this be just not a possible outcome , unless the alien be go to come down and whisk he away . secondly , i ask myself - do they read their own paper ? the strong economic record that you talk about be a fiction . and the record of balanced budget ? i do not think that one budget have be balance since they come to power . they be claim a balanced budget for the last year - it be not clear that this be true , but even if so , it be achieve by steal fund from the ei surplus , sell off the gm share below market value and under-spending the budget amount in most category . how can you not blame the party for the history of malfeasance , dirty trick and anti-democratic activity that you say be the reason for mr. harper to go ? it be the party that try to hide the duffy affair . it be the caucus that vote for the omnibus bill , for the shutting down of debate etc. . it be the caucus member who do not have the gut to either push back or resign when the pmo shove . and who be leave there to run a government ? flaherty be no long with we , mckay , moore , prentice , glover and baird all decide not to run again . and do you really think jason kenny be any different than the p.m. ? he have be lead the anti-muslim charge as much as the p.m. . your option seem to call for a time machine to take we back to the day of the good old pc - i be afraid that ship have sail . the cpc have be capture by reformer , neo- and theo - con and other who have no respect for joe clarke , or flora macdonald or bob stanfield or hugh segal . that person have be drum out of the party and it be not stephen harper 's do alone . i do not like mr. harper and will be glad if i see his back . but to somehow demonize he as some evil genius who have fool the rest of his party into trail along be inaccurate and frankly well below the usual standard of g&m journalism . i do not always agree with you but i usually understand the rationale of your comment . not this time !"

it be no fantasy that the sun media empire create harper voter and that karl p. own the sunday perhaps harper and his anti quebec stance be just a figment of karl p.

"another thing be low turnout do not necessarily mean party right of centre can not win . it do however mean they will have to have a broad appeal and certainly the harper base conservatives likely will not do this . in australia , they have have plenty of conservative government and they have mandatory voting . but since the liberals ( who be really conservative in australia ) rarely get over 50 % on the first ballot , they have to appeal to person 's second choice . in germany and france , turnout usually exceed 80 % yet the cdu / csu in germany and ump in france have a good win record than the conservatives in canada . the difference be in germany , usually it involve form coalition so they have to be willing to cooperate with other while in france it go to run off so much like australia they have to appeal as second choice of other . heck here in canada , turnout be usually over 70 % in the maritimes where pc party often win or in the last saskatchewan election it be 70 % where the saskatchewan party lead by brad wall win a record 64 % ( note harper 's support in saskatchewan have rang for a low of 42 % in 2004 to a high of 56 % in 2011 ) . the difference be the pc in atlantic canada be mostly red tories who appeal to a large segment and likewise brad wall maybe centre-right , but he be not a divisive type who hate anyone who disagree with he like harper . its true in the us , the gop benefit from low turnout , but that be because their policy be to the right of many and since the demographics most likely to vote gop be more likely to show up , they figure a low turnout benefit they . this be the path the conservatives seem to want to follow and be a bad choice in my view . they should find way to appeal to a broad demographic not suppress turnout on the basis their base be more likely to show up than other party 's ."
"perhaps this water - carrier for our incipient tyranny could look past the vouching sideshow and explain for a moment what possible good can come from have incumbent mp 's appoint polling station supervisor , or move decision - make power on whether to launch fraud investigation into a office control by the winner 's justice minister . it be a two - step plan to let incumbent cheat , and exert influence to make sure that investigation of that cheating only target the non-governing party . harper might as well just have tabl a bill to make himself president for life ."
"unfortunately , while i would like a change in government , the conservatives appear to be the only sensible choice . mr. trudeau need more experience . mr. mulcair , while a intelligent and articulate leader , still head a party whose policy would bring the country into economic ruin . so , while i agree with mr. simpson , it appear that we will have another conservative majority ."
"senior get blame for too many societal ill through broad generalization . i be a senior , relatively new to it as well . here be a few idea to ponder before generalize . health care : i do not know about canada but statistic i have read from another develop country , australia , indicate that senior can only be blame for something like 4 % of the rising cost of health care . you might consider rise rate of obesity and lack of fitness in young person as a cause of rise health care cost too . drug overdose , alcohol poisoning , stabbing and shooting , car collision as a result of speed and texting must play a part too . and then there be the corporate greed of pharmaceutical company and all the other supplier of medical equipment . jobs : i work hard to complete a education too . i enjoy my job and the ability to earn a living . youth can wait their turn as i do . wealth : i be not rich . i do not have the late flat screen tv ( there be good one discard at our local dump ) . i do not have a smart phone . my car have 250 000 kilometer on it and be good for much more . i do not eat out at the drop of a hat - cook everything from scratch because i enjoy do so . do so when my kid be grow up and i work . guess who do have all that thing plus debt of course . we save for our retirement . both our kid own their home because we give they part of their inheritance when they actually need it . ( also they pay their own way for most of their university education ) . we be not greedy . we pay for the grandchild 's resp . we buy the snow suit boot and shoe . we pay for a summer cottage rental for a week . we pay for lesson for the grandchild . we babysit for one week at a time because our daughter have to travel for work . we donate to the salvation army , united way , and a free lunch programme . our satisfaction from life come from be able to share . we do not need stuff - most person do not need as much stuff as they accumulate . it be just shopping therapy . all age need to look at what be important in life - it be not at walmart . then you can save for your future . i be sure that there be young person who be well educate and unemployed . i have know a few . they do not whine . they change expectation , use initiative and creativity to forge a new way of earn a living ."

the author might be correct . there be many factor . i think a simple fact of human nature be that person want to go home . to go back to their home and the life that they know good . we have the flood in southern alberta a few year ago . think of how many person in that situation still want to return to their neighbourhood despite their house be a complete write - off and now realize their neighbhourhood be in a flood zone and the inherent risk of live there in the future . person be comfortable with what they know good . person want to stay close . how many of the alberta flood victim would take the offer to be airlift to ontario to start a new life ? be it because ontario would not be welcoming . no . it be that person want to go back to their previous life . even if the chance be small . i think it be as simple as that and person should be respectful of the extremely difficult situation that the syrian person be in .
the cia and senator dianne feinstein both do some very reprehensible thing . the cia action have be widely report . the senator could not resist the opportunity to give the senate report a political twist leave it impossible to determine which reprehensible thing be fact and which reprehensible thing be fiction . country would not continue to use torture if such tactic do not produce the seek after information . the information obtain probably do help obama to find & kill osama . the world wide reputational damage be much great than the information gain by use such method .

"the fix election law be another meaningless bone throw to the con base . it be essentially unconstitutional as the constitution state that the queen can call a election at any time . the prime minister can go to the queen ( or her representative , the governor general ) at any time and ask for a election . gg never deny the reque of the p.m. . . there be not penalty in the legislation for whoever break the fix election date law . its just a bone to the base and another poorly think out piece of legislation enact by this government ."
"' when introduce the legislation , harper state that ' fix election date prevent government from call snap election for short - term political advantage . they level the playing field for all party and the rule be clear for everybody . ' [ 7 ] however , despite the new legislation , the prime minister be still free to request a election at any time . as the bill c - 16 amendment to the canada election act clearly state ' nothing in this section affect the power of the governor general , include the power to dissolve parliament at the governor general 's discretion ' , the change effectively alter only the maximum duration of a parliament by ensure that it end no late than october of the fourth calendar year after its commencement , while leave the possibility of a early end unaffected . [ 4 ] this situation be illustrate by the dissolution of parliament at harper 's request on september 7 , 2008 . this lead democracy watch to initiate proceedings in federal court against the crown - in - council , the prime minister of canada , and the governor general of canada , challenge the decision to call a election prior to the fix election date . judge michel m.j. shore dismiss the matter , say the applicant who launch the suit ' do not demonstrate a proper understanding of the separation of power , ' since ' [ trillion ] he remedy for the applicant 's contention be not for the federal court to decide , but rather one of the count of the ballot box ' . [ 8 ] the court effectively find that the fix election date be not bind on the prime minister or legally enforceable by the court . with election be hold in october 2008 ( after a early election call ) and may 2011 ( after a vote of non-confidence ) , no parliament have yet reach its maximum life . the election of a majority government in the may 2 , 2011 , general election make it probable that the date of the next general election will be determine by the fix - date section of the canada election actober [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] this would cause the next election to be on october 19 , 2015 .'- wiki ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ understand now , kid ?"
"correct i if i be wrong , but it would appear that margaret be argue that we should keep the current system that we have , one where we have public and catholic school board ( with parallel board for french instruction which she be not discuss but also exist ) . if this be the case her conclusion be logically flawed . margaret 's premise be that we should have catholic school because their student outcome be superior to the public board ( a feeling that many on this comment section seem to agree with ) . to explain why this be so , she present 2 reason ( or at least in quote a cd howe study she do ) and leave one reason to be imply . none of this reason support her contention that we maintain the current system . the first be that catholic school be selective ( '' maybe they be more selective ' quote from the author of the cd howe report ) . if you can control the input you have a good chance of improve the outcome . however , the purpose of public funding of education be to educate all , not just that we select . if society feel that it be good to be selective then we should be look at the abolishment of public funding for education and replace it with a bursary or grant system . we should not be look at maintain the current system . secondly ( and this be the one margaret spend most of her time on ) be the idea that competition make the catholic school good . left unsaid be why this same competition do not make the public school good , but i will leave that inconsistency aside for now . if that be the case , why be 2 the ideal number for competition ? would not it make sense to completely do away with the two board we currently have and go the charter school route ? then you would have real competition which would improve education even more dramatically . ( by the way i be totally oppose to this , but i be work within the constraint of margaret 's argument . ) the third reason be imply . if catholic school be good it must have something to do with their catholic nature . either catholic value , catholic culture , religious education , or something . if that be true then we be purposefully prevent 75 % of our kid from get a quality education by continue to fund public school . margaret should not be argue for maintain the status quo , she should be argue for abolish the public board . so , in conclusion , margaret 's argument be seriously flawed . by her logic we should be debate : 1 ) the existence of publicly fund school board completely , 2 ) the abolishment of public and catholic board completely to be replace with charter school , or 3 ) the abolishment of the public board so that all kid could be teach by the superior catholic board . of course that would imply that there have ever be logic in margaret 's argument ."

"harper talk down to person with his arrogant delivery . justin trudeau talk to person , and welcome their question , engage with they . when be the last time you see harper walk through a crowd at a event and actually engage with they ? not only that , but he will not even take question from the media . he think he be above it all , that he only have to deliver his narrow message to his base . that be why his approval rating have drop to historic low and that be why person ( even some in his base ) be feed - up with he . oh , and he be not middle of the road . we all know he be far more right than he try to project ."

"harper 's legacy would have be just poor without the bitumen fiasco . the totally incompetent handling of the bitumen file lower harper 's job rating to f-. however , there be still something where harper could shine . he could beat mulroney 's record if he valiantly stay on . mulroney 's approval rating be less than spectacular 9 % before he quit . harper could go below that without any extra effort ."
"dr morton shulman write a book call ' anyone can make a million ' . in it he talk about the investor he find most often make mistake : doctor . why ? because they work long hour and do not have the time to research investment opportunity , have too much disposable income and not enough time to consume , and always want a high return on any investment . shulman tell several anecdote of drs ask his advice on investment scheme after the fact and be outrage when he tell they they be either scam or lose venture . shulman just laugh . he be a socialist who have a keen eye for profit in our wonky capitalist system . and he know how to live the good life . of course ontario doctor do not get it . too many doctor in our system come from wealthy family and wealthy neighbourhood . they enter the system with a sense of entitlement and judge their own self - worth base on veblen 's concept of conspicuous consumption . too few know how to live the good life . i have know some wonderful doctor in my life . but i have also know some who look at i as if i be just money in the bank . in the last few year , most of the excellent doctor i have know have be woman . why ? i be not sure . but i do know the bad doctor i have ever have stank of alpha male syndrome ."
"oh look . the opposition , outraged how there be no consultation , or mad at time allocation , have a day today to debate this bill , yet the house of common be largely empty . gee , will the media highlight this fact ? feign outrage be more like it . it be shock their hypocrisy , yet guarantee , like several week ago when three day 's worth of debate take place , there again , the house be empty , yet all the opposition member go on all the talk show , blast harper for lack of debate , while they all fail to show up to debate the bill that very day ."

"one thing i love about american be that they be so outgoing as a person . i travel for business alot and in the us stranger talk to each other about anything and everything . even when you be travel alone , you feel as though you have human contact wherever you go . here we be much more reserve and go to great length to feel as though we be not bother other , but sometimes that can feel like isolation . overall i think canadian think about what american and other think about we too much ( they be probably barley think of we at all ) , and american be just live their life ."
"i know one thing that be a lot different . american know how to celebrate remembrance day . they have big veteran parade , with veteran and marching band . ww2 aircraft fly low over the parade street and the american legion have huge support from their community government . here in canada there be no remembrance day parade , little support from community government for legion ( most be be tax out of existence ) and no ww2 aircraft fly over the veteran parade ."
"i get the feeling that the person run the ndp campaign this federal election be the same fool who run the ndp campaign in bc . there , the bc liberals under christy clark be on the rope . they be tired and there be corruption scandal by the day . the public want change and be ready to vote in a ndp majority government . but the ndp have their leader ( dix ) tone himself down , stop attack the governing party that have be there for a long time and act like he be the premier . during the debate , the ndp leader ( dix ) fail to remind any of the viewer or put the premier on the spot regard any of the numerous scandal / lie / etc. . etc. . he do not make the premier accountable at all - just like mulcair have not go after harper for his lie and dishonesty and destruction of our institution . so what happen ? the ndp have a horrible night and the govern liberal stay in power . it look like the story be be repeat and harper will get away again ."
"a shame really . it have be proven 7 to 10 be a good age to start schooling . all grade and level of function and knowledge be identicle to early start and the child be good at thing like sitting , absorb , and even obey . teacher and care worker should not have to be comforting 3 and 4 year old ... some untrained even . they should be home with mom . or in a daycare for play and socialization .... money down the drain ...... put the same money into daycare !!!!!!!!!"
"i agree with margaret wente and have read the research on all day kindergartens . true a very few amount of child may benefit in a very small way , but the program do not do what it be suppose to do . it cost a lot of money !!! little child , some under 4 ( if their birthday be late in the year ) go to a big school , have no hot lunch , no sleep in the afternoon and sometimes have a teacher who know little about child development . we have a good child care system in ontario : this be where the money should have go , in make sure our young child be not raise in institution create for much other child . play base ? a good idea and it have be prove effective , but it be ' play base ' mean the goal be to develop executive function use active learning as a mean to achieve curriculum goal ... not just play , not just direction but a day share both adult guide and child guide learning . do this happen ? who know ? there be no accountability assessment in place , little teacher training and what happen in each classroom depend on the teacher . child care have be destroy by all day learning and i fear so have some child . moya fewson , senior trainer , highscope teacher education centre ."
"currently the cpc be oppose to a change in our electoral system to a ranked ballot , a system that ask voter to rank their preference . the conservatives reason that such a system would ensure liberal success since most person would rank the liberal party as either their first or second choice . i have always argue against this point because back in the day , most person would rank either the liberal or the progressive conservative party as either their first or second choice and under a ranked ballot system the current cpc would have to return to the day when that party be either the first or second choice of most person . here be a tentative little prediction from i : if the ndp leap sharply to the left then the cpc need do nothing to become most person 's first or second choice . we will be back to the day when the ndp be the third party conscience of canada and the current cpc party will have no further objection to a ranked ballot system ."
as soon as wente choose a job where you she put her life at risk almost daily and one which significantly reduce life span then she can complain about salary of person do that job . funny i do not hear her whine about the exorbitant salary pay to oil field worker . do not forget the oil company be heavily subsidize with tax dollar .
"the arbitration system that ms. wente decry be a independent , jointly - select panel that weigh evidence from both side while look at comparable wage . its goal be to replicate the result that would have occur have the party be able to negotiate a settlement . this panel be require to consider a municipality 's ability to pay . in fact , though employer can argue their ability to pay , the truth be that they rarely do so . arbitration panel must be pretty successful because a analysis of arbitrate settlement vs. freely - negotiate fire fighter salary increase in the past five year show virtually no difference between the two ."

"i fully agree that the ' remain ' side be far too cavaly in its dismissal of the economic concern of the ' leave ' voter and that be a lesson for all of we . however here be the thing i do not understand : while the eu 's lack of border have certainly make it easy for cheap labour to migrate to the uk , surely the dearth of work in the industrial heartland be the result of year of botch british domestic policy follow the end of the second world war . take your pick really . labour 's nanny state or thatcher 's unfeeling economy - all british decision that lay the groundwork for the current crisis . and not just economic but cultural . labour 's multicultural police fail to integrate effectively and the conservatives fail to welcome effectively . truth be tell , both side seem to be at fault here and the only good news be that the rest of we have a interesting test case for what happen when globalization hit the rock . hopefully we can learn from it ."

you have to give harper and his yes man point for consistency . when they tell the crtc to set up a do not call registry they exempt ' politician ' from not call number register with the dnc registry .-- corrupt politician often end up exempt themselves from the rule they expect everyone else to follow .
the conservative approach of ' borrow and spend ' be bad than the ' tax and spend ' approach with which they would like to paint the other party . the harper conservatives have be inept economic manager .

"gagnon be almost certainly incorrect in claim that : ' my forebear never know another country than canada . they never have another native language than french . ' roughly 10 % of the ancestry of ' old - stock ' french - canadian be germanic , e.g. from german mercenary who fight with the french or , late , with the british . ( cf . http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science-et-technologie/28851/patrimoine-genetique-du-sang-allemand-chez-des-quebecois ) . it be a reasonable guess they speak german or dutch and remember the taste of their mother 's cooking , despite rapid assimilation into french canada . and there be various other immigrant who assimilate into french canada ( such as the irish ) . not to mention the occasional aboriginal convert who marry into the francophone group , though of course they be not immigrant . and of course the offspring of illegitimate relationship that do not even show up in genealogical record . if there be no in - breeding ( marriage of cousin etc. . ) at all in gagnon 's family tree , she have 1000 - 2000 ancestor in her family tree go back to the early 17th century . the chance that none of this be anything other than french / descendent of french be very slim indeed . but hey , why let fact get in the way of a good story ..."

"in bedford versus . canada the government rely on witness from the us who be fund in the bush era to travel to country consider lift prostitution prohibition . their research , as find by justice himel , be not up to court standard but do by advocate of prohibition . we see ngo set up in canada since 2010 , around the time the court of appeal decide in favour of relief to prostitute , which be very center on mischaracterize the case and fear - mongering . mp joy smith have jump on the bandwagon and start her own ngo which also seek to discredit the many supporter of bedford vs. canada . we must ask about the funding both domestic and international of this organization which actively seek to influence the court and use ' research ' discredite by our own court . see justice himel 's decision ."
"bedford vs. canada be a application for declaratory relief of the current prostitution law . even joy smith , prohibitionist and a host of other be propose change to the current law by put forth a ' swedish ' or ' nordic ' model . to try to connect the case to a ' vision ' of the future through the court be wrong , and the proper forum for that be parliament should the judge agree to strike down the challenge law . macleans first point out even before justice himel make her ruling , that this case be about the charter of right . ( though macleans do not understand at the time how negative right be simply tool in judge hand to force parliament to listen . ) sweden be a homogenous , small and more prosperous society . they never have a prostitution problem ; they want to make a egalitarian statement . for other country , everyone have a opinion , but the justice dept be the proper place to look at the effect of new law . and the justice dept for country where prostitution law have be strike down say thing have not change much , it be too early to tell . i hear , though i be not clear , that the scc judge may have be ask in the record to consider put the exploitive part of the living off the avail law into the presumption law ( there be thousand of page to this case , it be hard to know everything ) . though there be pimping law , should help the put the mind of that at ease who can not see past link the avail law with pimp , even though they be wrong . that would be a make in canada solution ; we really need a canadian compromise ."

"justin certainly say nothing wrong about examine root cause , even if stephen harper and the herald editorial board try to spin it into something else . you have to wonder if all cylinder be fire in the pmo when they can not even read and comprehend a simple interview ."
what be this ? 2004 ? at any rate there be more useful information within the comment than in the actual article which appear to pander to some and patronize other .. i believe .. and i make what change i could and i still believe that change be useful even though i be no long sell on what person like you be sell . be i a denier ? nope . just not a true believer . why ? well .. in the early part of the last decade media type put the fear into we to such a extent i decide to try and educate myself somewhat on the issue . i be concerned . once i start read what scientist and their research team be actually say ( as oppose to the politicized debate .. ) i realize there be a lot more to this and the science certainly be not settle .
"interesting that the author portray the debate as ' science versus religious dogma ' . of course , any enlightened person should be able to see the difference . but despite the spout of biblical text from the fringe that be not really what be go on be it ? the climate change movement have allow itself to devolve into just another religion - supposedly science - base in theory - complete with the language religion typically use to denounce opponent : denier , skeptic , non-believer . be it any wonder politician have be sit on the climate change fence ? it be almost come down to a ' church versus state ' argument . politician have be leave guess which way the wind be blow so the smart one have be hedge their bet . just look at the ghg reduction plan and agreement . mostly talk with general non-binding agreement to meet future target . kyoto fizzle . the us - china agreement be hail as a victory except that china 's would start cap emission by 2030 and aim to get 20 per cent of its energy from zero - carbon source by the same year'wow - what a breakthrough .

miss wente raise the issue ' why can not today 's graduate get hire ? ' but provide no analysis or answer . when one read the commentary one see that they be generally on par with miss wente . hence one can conclude that education have obviously serious defect in canada .
"it be heartening to read the intelligent post where the poster have refrain from pit one country against another especially since canada and india have longstanding bilateral tie , build upon share value of democracy and pluralism . there be a number of canadian live and work in india too and never hear of anyone make a hue and cry about their presence . in fact there be around 250 small and big canadian company operate in india and this be of benefit to not only they but could overall boost canada 's economy by at least $ 6 billion . that translate to almost 40000 new job across canada , or a $ 500 boost to the average canadian family 's annual income . it be for each country to decide its foreign policy and only the ignorant or prejudiced would blame another for it . read more : www . <unk>"
