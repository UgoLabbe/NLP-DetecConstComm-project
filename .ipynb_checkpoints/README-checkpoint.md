For Milestone 1 of the Project exercise your team should gather the dataset(s) they are planning to use, perform standard preprocessing steps and INSPECT THE RESULTS to uncover potential issues that need to be handled. 
Finally, datasets should be stored in CoNLL-U format and pushed to the repository together with a short documentation of how the data was created.
